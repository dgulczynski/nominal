 abstract = {This paper formalises within first-order logic some common practices in computer science to do with representing and reasoning about syntactical structures involving lexically scoped binding constructs. It introduces Nominal Logic, a version of first-order many-sorted logic with equality containing primitives for renaming via name-swapping, for freshness of names, and for name-binding. Its axioms express properties of these constructs satisfied by the FM-sets model of syntax involving binding, which was recently introduced by the author and M.J. Gabbay and makes use of the Fraenkel-Mostowski permutation model of set theory. Nominal Logic serves as a vehicle for making two general points. First, name-swapping has much nicer logical properties than more general, non-bijective forms of renaming while at the same time providing a sufficient foundation for a theory of structural induction/recursion for syntax modulo \alpha-equivalence. Secondly, it is useful for the practice of operational semantics to make explicit the equivariance property of assertions about syntax --- namely that their validity is invariant under name-swapping.}

 abstract = {In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.}
